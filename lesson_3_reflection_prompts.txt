When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I don't have my computer and can't clone my repository to the laptop I'm using, simply add code on the internet. Simple. 
  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  I might not want to make changes from the changes I made in my remote repository later. Or I have made change in A, and did the same in my computer. There could be conflict. Maybe I would have wanted to test different version from the one in remote repository.
