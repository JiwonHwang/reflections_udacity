What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	git init # creates a new repository 
	Initialized empty Git repository in <location>

	# .git is created. 

	git log # to check git commit history
	git status # to check any changes after the latest commit 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area gathers files from working directory and pushes it to the repository. I can make meaningful/logical commmit.
